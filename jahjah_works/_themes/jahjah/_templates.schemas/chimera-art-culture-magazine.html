    <small>
      Jah Jah is a twenty-four year old Houston-based artist whose paintings
      are mind-bending in nature. His lines create cerebral mazes that might
      be described as tribal, futuristic and sometimes incredibly
      psychedelic. Some of his work is almost chaotic at first glance, but
      if you look a little closer you’ll find geometrical patterns and
      symbols which he has conjured over the last few years. His work can be
      found in the crevices of Houston, including a recent mural at The Silo
      near Last Concert Café in the Warehouse district. Currently, Jah Jah
      is working with the Uriel Landeros to create a mission statement for
      their collective art group, Annunaki. He will also be participating in
      a collaborative show with local artists Juan Carlos and Nina Marinick
      in November.

      Right now painting is my focus but I spend a lot of my time drawing,
      using pencil and pen on paper. I don’t do a lot of photography or even
      sculpture, or anything three-dimensional. It’s mostly drawing and
      painting at the moment.

      Growing up I was always encouraged to keep on painting and keep
      drawing and I guess I can say throughout all my training in school.
      Being on my own with my art outside of school, I don’t think it came
      until a couple of years ago when I just kind of decided to throw away
      everything I knew, or thought I knew, about art and created my own way
      of doing it. So I neglected everything I learned and freed my hand up.
      A lot of the art I was making looked kind of childlike and then the
      more I did it, the more organized it became and it sort of evolved
      into this thing that you see now, something that’s based off of
      intuition, free-form and spontaneity.

      The development begins inherently as a free-flowing thing and the more
      [time] I spend not being concerned with where I’m going the more
      things are shown to me. And these processes that come out of not
      having any, or having little control over what’s next, I create
      processes out of that. So each new thing that I do, or each new
      process that I try or come across is one extra thing I have in my
      database of processes and things that I can do. They kind of form each
      other- the free-flowing and the more compositional aspect.

      There is a feeling and it’s that feeling that I’ve been chasing and
      that two years ago I finally found, that I was able to channel at will
      whenever I picked up any type of writing or creating utensil. It’s a
      feeling that this could go on forever, unstopped without any type of
      boost or help from any outside… anything- and it could sustain itself
      without dying out, that feeling of infinity or forever existing. When
      I’m in that zone it’s like each brush stroke could be the equivalent
      to an inhale or an exhale. You can actually create on a piece of paper
      or canvas the same you can create a dance piece or a whole theater
      performance.

      Personally, I feel like when it comes to energy and these concepts
      such as spirit, I think when you’re creating, drawing or painting
      you’re engaging in a form of meditation. And meditation in most
      religions has been proclaimed to be the one thing that you can do to
      tap into a universal energy field, or [to] see everything as one. I
      have a feeling that maybe when you create, you connect yourself to
      that. One the biggest aspects of creating is just being present at the
      moment that you’re doing it.

      When I look at people who inspire me, it’s not necessarily the work of
      these people that inspires me, it’s really the work ethic, to see how
      these people went about their lives or how they went about creating
      whatever it is that they create. Looking at what was produced based of
      how much energy and time was put into it, it’s really that that I’m
      inspired by when it comes to other people. When it comes to
      techniques, I don’t have very many people who have influenced me. I
      have looked at Escher before and I’ve seen some similarities in how
      geometry is used and as far as subject matter I’m not really
      influenced by many other artists when it comes down to [it]. I tend to
      pull from ideas that I come up with and things that are inside me.
      There are particular symbols that I’ve used though. And I guess I have
      this sort of database of symbols that I’ve created and that I’ve
      borrowed.

      One symbol is the symbol of a bull. That’s something that another
      artist Uriel Landeros uses, and it’s also a symbol that Picasso used.
      I also have imagery of birds. A symbol I use frequently is a symbol
      for a woman, it is an upside down triangle. Some of the symbols are
      personal, especially my logo. There are some symbols that are more
      conventional- an infinity sign, a cross, a star- there’s one for
      water, a symbol for wind, a circle inside a circle is a common one.
      When I’m working in my journal and have thoughts, I record them-
      sometimes I think about symbols or I have to write down a slogan or
      just some sentence that I think of and in a way I use that as a
      reminder, so these words that I come up with become assigned a word or
      phrase and ultimately I write down that symbol and I know what is
      associated with it so quietly informs me every time I see it.

      Recently I’ve been collaborating with a few people- Nina Marinick and

      He’s serving for spray-painting a Picasso piece. He’ll be out in
      November of this year. I don’t know the details of our collaboration,
      but I will definitely be collaborating with him when he gets out. We
